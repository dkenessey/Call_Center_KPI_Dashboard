<h1 style="font-size:24px;"> <b> 1. Project Description </b> </h1>
This project aims to provide insights into the performance of a call center during the most recent month of operation. 

<h1 style="font-size:24px;"> <b> 2. Dataset </b> </h1>
The call center data is shared via an .xlsx file. The dataset contains 5000 rows and 10 columns (call id, agent, date, time, topic, answered, resolved, average talk duration, and satisfaction rating). The dataset was provided by Alex Freberg through Analyst Builder's Data Visualization in Tabealu module.

<h1 style="font-size:24px;"> <b> 3. Software used </b> </h1>
Tableau - data visualization

<h1 style="font-size:24px;"> <b> 4. Key Findings </b> </h1>
- The highest number of calls were received on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. <br>
- In the past month, 70% of incoming calls were resolved. <br>
- On the most recent day of the current month, the call center received 27 calls, each lasting approximately 4 minutes. <br>
- Most calls received satisfaction ratings between 3 and 5. <br>
- The top three agents with the fastest call response rates were Stewart, Becky, and Diane, while those with the slowest response rates were Martha, Greg, and Dan. <br>
- The top three agents with the highest resolution rates were Martha, Stewart, and Jim, while those with the lowest resolution rates were Diane, Joe, and Dan. <br>

<h1 style="font-size:24px;"> <b> 4. Recommendations </b> </h1>
- <b>Staffing Adjustments:</b> On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, when the highest call volumes are received, increase staffing to effectively manage the increased workload. <br>
- <b>Improving Performance:</b> Overall, Sundays have the lowest average satisfaction and resolution ratings of all days. To improve these ratings, incentivize work on Sundays for high performers (e.g., Martha and Stewart). <br>
- <b>Mentorship Program Development:</b> Pair high performers (e.g., Becky and Stewart) with lower performers (e.g., Dan and Joe) to provide one-on-one training and mentorship on improving call resolution effectiveness and response time. <br>
- <b>Training and Monitoring:</b> Monitor and review unresolved calls to identify patterns in the issues that go unresolved. Once these patterns are identified, implement specialized training to address these issues, ultimately improving resolution rates. <br>
